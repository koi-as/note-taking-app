## Usage

There are already some useful tips in that app, however, it helps to know what you're getting into! </br>

First, when you get to the home page, you will be presented with a button. Simply click on the button to take you to the notes app. </br>
Once you are on the note screen, you will see 3 distinct areas:
* The navbar: Here you can find the page title. Clicking on it will take you back to the landing page. There is also the save and new note buttons that will appear as you use the app
* The left-hand column: This is where saved notes will populate. It will display the title of the note, and clicking on the title populates the right-hand column with the note contents. While there is also a delete button, it is unfortunately not functional, which is something I hope to work on in the future.
* The right-hand column: This is the meat of the app. Here there are two sections: title and text. Simply click on each area, add some text, then click on the save icon to save that note.
